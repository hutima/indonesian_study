//  Consolidated grammar drills covering textbook chapters 1–20 and the
//  eight lecture-week supplements (W1O–W8O). Multiple-choice only.
//  Forms are stored explicitly rather than generated, to keep accents
//  and endings honest.
//
//  Replaces three previous files:
//    js/data/grammar.js         (first-pass)
//    js/data/grammar_extra.js   (second-pass additions)
//    js/data/grammar_focus.js   (third-pass focused drills)
//
//  Card-shape contract (consumed by app.js / pos_logic.js):
//    {
//      id:        string   (regenerated each session)
//      kind:      'morph'  (multiple-choice prompt)
//      required:  true
//      sourceKey: string   ("1"–"20" or "W1O"–"W8O")
//      sourceLabel, chapter, family, lemma, gloss,
//      form, prompt, context, note, answer, choices[]
//    }
//
//  Each `questions[].choices` array is canonical here; the builder
//  shuffles it (and dedupes the answer) before returning.
